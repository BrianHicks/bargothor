# Bargothor

Bargothor is a very large moon orbiting a world "sort of close" to old
Earth. Unfortunately, we don't know why the moon was colonized or even where
Earth is, because Bargothors records were destroyed in conflict. All we really
know is that the genetically fittest candidates were chosen to be Earth's envoys
to the stars, and sent on a generation ship lightyears away from their ancestral
home.

## Local System

Bargothor is one of several moons orbiting the gas supergiant Bargothor Prime
(to be very precise, the world we call Bargothor is really Bargothor-III.) It is
the largest and most habitable of the moons. The others are generally small and
rocky or very icy. There is one standout, however: the desert moon of Hadi.

### Bargothor Itself

Bargothor is a terrestrial world about two thirds the size of Earth (but with
standard gravity, accounted for by its density). Its air is breathable to human
lifeforms, although there are pockets of a airborne substance known as
"ichor". The native lifeforms thrive off of this substance, but it is toxic to
genetically unmodified humans. The world is mostly land, but about half of the
surface is covered by liquid water. This is saltwater, of about twice the
concentration one would expect to find on Earth.

### Bargothor Prime

Bargothor Prime is a gas supergiant, about 80 times the size of Jupiter. Like
many gas giants, Bargothor Prime is composed mostly of hydrogen, and a bit of
helium. Mining outposts have been established in low orbit, and most technology
on Bargathor is powered by electricity derived from gasses mined from Bargathor
Prime.

### Hadi

Hadi is a small but superdense moon of Bargothor Prime. It is the outermost
moon, and rotates such that the same side of the moon always faces the system's
star. Because of this, one side of the moon is *very* hot, and one side is still
barren, but quite cold. There is a habitable strip between these two zones, cast
in eternal twilight. Minimally explored, and filled with all sorts of caves and
asteroid impact sites, especially outside of the habitable zone.

## Historical Timeline

We don't know a lot about the events before around 140AP (after planetfall), but
we have a rough sketch:

- 0AP: planetfall, initial colonization attempts
- 50AP: major civilizations established, a reasonable standard of living for
  most beings
- 80AP: Viscii attack "pure human" settlements
- 93AP: Viscii attacks become worse, pre-Carcallan empire formed
- 143AP: First Legator (Carcallus) elected by the world senate
- 148AP: Legator Carcallus begins a campaign of extermination against
  cybernetically and biologically enhanced humanoids
- 152AP: all-out war between Carcallan Empire, Ghidorians (cybernetically
  enhanced humans) and Viscii (biologically enhanced humans). Most historical
  records are lost during this conflict.
- 155-210AP: a series of Legators are either elected or take over by force, the
  Sea expands to promote Carcallan ideology in all but a handful of regions on
  the moon.

## Factions

### The Caracalla

The Caracalla are a global empire of human purists. Their culture absolutely
refuses any sort of obvious genetic or cybernetic enhancement, although they do
accept various smaller enhancements that improve their quality of life without
making them "impure" (disease resistance and allopathic/osteopathic
disciplines.) Those that choose to refuse this creed are doomed to live on the
outskirts of society. Because of this, their lives are short and brutal and
their culture emphasizes fame after death both through achievements in life and
going down in a blaze of glory.

The Caracalla are governed by the Imperial Senate, a unicameral congress led by
the Legator. The Senate must approve most actions taken by the Legator, but the
position has historically been held by very strong and charismatic individuals
who mostly rule over the populace with an iron fist. Because of this and their
history of imperialism, the Caracalla have the strongest military presence of
the three factions. Called the "Sea", this military has outposts over the whole
of the moon, and keeps order according to the laws of the Imperial Senate.

### Ghidorians

The Ghidorians reject the "pure" creed adopted by the Carcalla. While their
numbers are few, they practice their technological mastery with frightening
efficiency. Their outposts (and hidden capitol city of Ghidoria) are highly
automated, such that they are nearly completely self-sustaining. The most
advanced of their number hide in extreme secrecy, as the Sea has put a high
price on their heads. They have recently developed self-aware artificial
intelligence. Although this technology is not yet commonly adopted, a few
human-size prototypes have emerged from their labs.

The Ghidorians are led by a small council of elder roboticists. The council
currently has 5 seats, one for each of the five wards in Ghidoria. The purpose
of the council is mostly to preserve the knowledge of the Ghidorians from
external forces, and to recover that which was lost in the Carcallan wars. The
few thousand "everyday" Ghidorians respect their influence and protection, but
are mostly self-governing.

- Plural: Ghidorians

### Viscii (bio)

In 143AP, the first Visca was created by Akrina Sova, a pre-Carcallan
scientist, by heavily modifying the human genome to produce what she thought of
as an "optimal" life form for the moon's conditions. Sova brought her creation
before the planetary senate, and they strongly objected. Sova was quickly forced
into exile, and continued her experimentation there, assisted by some of her
colleagues. Over the years, she and the now-sentient Viscii would go on to wage
war on what became the Carcallan empire.

Because of Sova's exile, not much is known of the power structure of the
Viscii. It is believe that they share a hive-mind, and Carcallan mothers often
scare their children into obedience by threatening to feed them to the Viscii.
