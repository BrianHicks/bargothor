## High-level Notes

Bargothor is the setting for a Fate (Accelerated Edition) campaign I'm running. Major points:

 - high technology
 - no FTL travel
 - futurey, robots 'n such

The players haven't yet approved of the setting, so there may be minor tweaks,
but you can see a [description of the world and major forces](bargothor.md).

## Joining

If you'd like to join us, we can try to get you in. If you're in St. Louis,
it's easy. Send me a message (contact information is in my GH profile) and we'll
figure out schedules. If you're remote, we can try and connect over Skype or
Hangouts, but no guarantees! Send me a message anyway.
