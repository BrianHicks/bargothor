## High-level Notes

Bargothor is the setting for a Fate (Accelerated Edition) campaign I'm running. Major points:

 - high technology
 - no FTL travel
 - futurey, robots 'n such

The players haven't yet approved of the setting, so there may be minor tweaks,
but you can see a [description of the world and major forces](bargothor.md).
